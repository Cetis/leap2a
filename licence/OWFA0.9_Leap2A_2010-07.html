<ol>
 <li><p><em>The Purpose of this Agreement.</em> This Agreement sets forth the
   terms under which I make certain copyright and patent rights available
   to you for your Implementation of the Specification.  Capitalized
   terms are defined in the Agreement's last section.  </p> </li>

 <li><p><em>Copyright.</em> </p>

	<ol>
	 <li><p><em>Copyright Grant.</em> I grant to you a perpetual (for the
	   duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive,
	   no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation
	   for accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
	   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and
	   implement the Specification to the full extent of my copyright
	   interest in the Specification.  </p> </li>
	 <li><p><em>Attribution.</em> As a condition of the copyright grant, you
	   must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative
	   work you make based on the Specification.  That attribution must
	   include, at minimum, the Specification name and version number.  </p> </li>
	</ol>

 </li>

 <li><p><em>Patents.</em> </p>

<ol>
 <li><p><em>Patent Non-Assert.</em> </p>

<ol>
 <li><p><em>The Promise.</em> I, on behalf of myself and my successors in
   interest and assigns, irrevocably promise not to assert my
   Necessary Claims against you for your Implementation, subject
   to the following.  This is a personal promise directly from me
   to you, and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from
   it that no rights from me are received from suppliers,
   distributors, or otherwise in connection with this promise.
   This promise also applies to your making, using, selling,
   offering for sale, importing or distributing an implementation
   of any subsequent derivative works incorporating the
   Specification 1) only to the extent that it implements the
   Specification, and 2) so long as all required portions of the
   Specification are implemented.  This promise does not extend
   to any portion of the derivative work that was not included in
   the Specification.  </p> </li>

 <li><p><em>Termination.</em> </p>

<ol>
 <li><p><em>As a Result of Claims by You.</em> All rights, grants, and
   promises made by me to you under this Agreement are
   terminated if you file, maintain, or voluntarily
   participate in a lawsuit against me or any person or
   entity asserting that its Implementation infringes your
   Necessary Claims, unless that suit was in response to a
   corresponding suit first brought against you.  </p> </li>
 <li><p><em>As Result of Claims by a Related Entity.</em> If a Related
   Entity of mine files, maintains, or voluntarily
   participates in a lawsuit asserting that an Implementation
   infringes its Necessary Claims, then I relinquish any
   rights, grants, and promises I have received for the
   Specification from other signatories of this Agreement,
   unless a) my promise to you was terminated pursuant to
   section 3.1.2.1, or b) that suit was in response to a
   corresponding suit first brought by you against the
   Related Entity.  </p> </li>
</ol>

 </li>

 <li><p><em>Additional Conditions.</em> This promise is not an assurance
   (i) that any of my copyrights or issued patent claims covers
   an Implementation or are enforceable or (ii) that an
   Implementation would not infringe intellectual property rights
   of any third party.  Notwithstanding the personal nature of my
   promise, this promise is intended to be binding on any future
   owner, assignee or exclusive licensee who has been given the
   right to enforce any Necessary Claims against third parties.  </p> </li>
 <li><p><em>Bankruptcy.</em> Solely for purposes of Section 365(n) of
   Title 11, United States Bankruptcy Code and any equivalent law
   in any foreign jurisdiction, this promise will be treated as
   if it were a license and you may elect to retain your rights
   under this promise if I (or any owner of any patents or patent
   applications referenced herein), as a debtor in possession, or
   a bankruptcy trustee, reject this non-assert.  </p> </li>
</ol>
 </li>

 <li><p><em>Patent License Commitment.</em> In addition to rights granted in
   3.1, on behalf of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I
   agree to grant to you a no charge, royalty free license to my
   Necessary Claims on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms solely
   for your Implementation.  </p> </li>
</ol>

 </li>

 <li><p><em>Good Faith Obligation.</em> I agree that I have not and will not
   knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing my
   obligations under this Agreement.  </p> </li>

 <li><p><em>Disclaimers.</em> THIS SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS.&quot;  I expressly
   disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including
   implied warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a
   particular purpose, or title, related to the Specification.  The
   entire risk as to implementing or otherwise using the Specification is
   assumed by the Specification implementer and user.  IN NO EVENT WILL
   ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
   CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS
   AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
   NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.  All of my obligations
   under Section 3 regarding the transfer, successors in interest, or
   assignment of Necessary Claims will be satisfied if I notify the
   transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Necessary
   Claims of the obligations under Section 3.  Nothing in this Agreement
   requires me to undertake a patent search.  </p> </li>
