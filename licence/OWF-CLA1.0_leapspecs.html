<h1>Open Web Foundation<br />
Contributor License Agreement<br />
(CLA 1.0)</h1>
<h2>(Patent and Copyright Grants)</h2>


<h3>1. The Purpose of this Contributor License Agreement.</h3>
<p>This CLA sets forth the terms
under which I will participate in and contribute to the development of the Specification.
Capitalized terms are defined in the CLA’s last section.</p>

<h3>2. Copyrights.</h3>


<dl>
<dt>2.1. <em>Copyright Grant</em>.</dt>
<dd>I grant to you a perpetual
(for the duration of the applicable copyright), worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license, without any obligation for
accounting to me, to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
publicly perform, sublicense, distribute, and implement any Contribution to the
full extent of my copyright interest in the Contribution. 
</dd>

<dt>2.2. <em>Attribution</em>.</dt> 
<dd>As a condition of the copyright grant, you
must include an attribution to the Specification in any derivative work you
make based on the Specification. That
attribution must include, at minimum, the Specification name and version
number. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>3. Patents.</h3>


<dl>
<dt>3.1. <em>Patent Non-Assert</em>.</em> 
</dt>
<dd>
  <dl>
  <dt>3.1.1. <em>The Promise</em>.</dt>
  <dd>I, on behalf of myself and my successors in interest and assigns,
irrevocably promise not to assert my Granted Claims against you for your
Permitted Uses, subject to the terms and conditions of Section 3.1. This is a personal promise directly from me
to you, and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from it that no rights
from me are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise in connection with
this promise.
This promise also applies to your Permitted Uses of any other specifications
incorporating all required portions of the Specification. 
  </dd>

  <dt>3.1.2. <em>Termination</em>.</dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
    <dt>3.1.2.1. <em>As a Result of Claims by You</em>.</dt>
    <dd>All rights,
grants, and promises made by me to you under this CLA are terminated if you
file, maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against me or any
person or entity asserting that its Permitted Uses infringe any Granted Claims you would have had the right
to enforce had you signed this CLA, unless that suit was in response to a
corresponding suit first brought against you.
    </dd>

    <dt>3.1.2.2. <em>As a Result of Claims by a Related Entity of Mine</em>.</dt>
    <dd>If a Related Entity of mine files, maintains,
or voluntarily participates in a lawsuit asserting that a Permitted Use
infringes any Granted Claims it would have had the right to enforce had it
signed this CLA, then I relinquish any rights, grants, and promises I have
received for the Specification from other signatories of this CLA, unless a) my
promise to you was terminated pursuant to section 3.1.2.1, or b) that suit was
in response to a corresponding suit first brought by you against the Related
Entity.
    </dd>
    </dl>

  <dt>3.1.3. <em>Additional Conditions</em>.</dt>
  <dd>This promise is not an
assurance (i) that any of my copyrights or issued patent claims cover an implementation
of the Specification or are enforceable or (ii) that an implementation of the
Specification would not infringe intellectual property rights of any third
party. Notwithstanding the personal nature of my promise, this promise
is intended to be binding on any future owner, assignee or exclusive licensee
who has been given the right to enforce any Granted Claims against third
parties.
  </dd>

  <dt>3.1.4. <em>Bankruptcy</em>.</dt>
  <dd>Solely for purposes of Section 365(n) of Title 11, United States
Bankruptcy Code and any equivalent law in any foreign jurisdiction, this
promise will be treated as if it were a license and you may elect to retain
your rights under this promise if I (or any owner of any patents or patent
applications referenced herein), as a debtor in possession, or a bankruptcy
trustee, reject this non-assert.
  </dd>
  </dl>

<dt>3.2. <em>Patent License Commitment</em>.</dt>
<dd>In addition to rights granted
in 3.1, on behalf of me and my successors in interest and assigns, I
agree to grant to you a no charge, royalty free license to my Granted Claims on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, where such license applies only to
those Granted Claims infringed by the implementation of my Contribution(s)
alone or by combination of my Contribution(s) with the Specification, solely
for your Permitted Uses.
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>4. No Other Rights.</h3>
<p> Except as specifically set forth in this CLA, no other express or
implied patent, trademark, copyright, or other property rights are granted
under this CLA, including by implication, waiver, or estoppel.</p>

<h3>5.  Limited Opt-Out. </h3>
<p>I may withdraw
my Contribution by providing written notice of that withdrawal within 45 days
of submitting that Contribution. Notice
of a Contribution withdrawal must be made, at minimum, in writing using the
same communication mechanisms that were used to submit the corresponding
Contribution and must include the exact material being withdrawn. Upon
providing such valid notice, any obligations I incurred under this CLA for that
particular identified Contribution will be null and void.</p>

<h3>6.  Open Web Foundation Agreement ("OWFa") version 1.0 Execution.</h3>
<p>I acknowledge that the goal of this CLA is to
develop a specification that will be subject to the OWFa version 1.0. While I have no legal obligation to execute
the OWFa version 1.0 for any version of the specification being
developed under this CLA, I agree that the selection and terms of the OWFa
version 1.0 will not be subject to negotiation.</p>

<h3>7.  Antitrust Compliance.</h3>
<p>I acknowledge that
I may compete with other participants, that I am under no obligation to implement
the Specification, that each participant is free to develop competing
technologies and standards, and that each party is free to license its patent
rights to third parties, including for the purpose of enabling competing
technologies and standards.</p>

<h3>8.  Non-Circumvention.</h3> 
<p>I agree
that I will not intentionally take or willfully assist any third party to take
any action for the purpose of circumventing my obligations under this CLA.</p>

<h3>9.  Representations, Warranties and Disclaimers.</h3> 
<p>I represent and warrant that 1) I am legally
entitled to grant the rights and promises set forth in this CLA and 2) I
will not intentionally include any third party materials in any Contribution
unless those materials are available under terms that do not conflict with this
CLA. IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS MY CONTRIBUTIONS ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS
IS.&quot; The entire risk as to
implementing or otherwise using the Contribution or the Specification is
assumed by the implementer and user. Except as stated herein, I expressly
disclaim any warranties (express, implied, or otherwise), including implied
warranties of merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for a particular
purpose, or title, related to the Contribution or the Specification. IN NO
EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM
OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS CLA, WHETHER BASED
ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER
OR NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. All
of my obligations under Section 3 regarding the transfer, successors in
interest, or assignment of Granted Claims will be satisfied if I notify the
transferee or assignee of any patent that I know contains Granted Claims of the
obligations under Section 3. Nothing in this CLA requires me to undertake a
patent search. </p>
